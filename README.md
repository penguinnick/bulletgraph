# bulletgraph
to make bullet graphs to compare error ranges

This code will eventually meet the needs of a very small group of people struggling with bullet graph creation

In this r script, you create a matrix of three columns by two rows for observation counts.
The perrorRange function will compute error ranges from the proportions of observations.
Variables are set within the bullet graph for min and max ranges for the 80%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels.
